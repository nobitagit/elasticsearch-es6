Elasticsearch + ES6 autocomplete demo

How to start this project:
- clone it
- run `npm i`
- run `npm run build`
- start an ElasticSearch instance
- open `dist/index.html`

Once the page is open:
- press the button to create an index
- add 'title' and 'content', press 'post' (repeat a few times to grow the index)
- type in the search field and see the autocomplete kick in
